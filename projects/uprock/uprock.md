## About

```markdown
# What is this network?

UpRock is an innovative DePIN network fueling the AI internet future that simplifies the process of auto-earning tokens, staking them, and redeeming them for rewards, making your journey in the web3 space as effortless as possible. Through our platform, users earn tokens by sharing their idle internet bandwidth and through staking, turning these tokens into real-world perks like flights and airtime minutes. Weâ€™re on a mission to make crypto assets more accessible and rewarding.

## How can I mine tokens?

You can mine tokens by sharing your idle bandwidth and compute power through UpRock's cross platform apps available to download at [uprock.com](https://uprock.com) The process is automated; once you're set up in under 2 minutes, our system manages the token mining based on available bandwidth, ensuring it doesn't interfere with your regular internet use.

## Any geographical restrictions?

Yes, our services are available except in countries currently restricted by the Play Store and App Store due to their policies. This ensures compliance with global regulations and platform guidelines.

## How can I optimize my mining rewards?

Optimizing your mining rewards involves maintaining a stable and secure internet connection and participating actively in the network. The more bandwidth you're able to share, especially during peak demand times, the more you can potentially earn.

In addition, consider installing the apps on multiple devices, as each contributes to your earnings. Additionally, by referring friends and family, you not only expand our community but also receive bonus tokens for each successful signup and a percentage kickback, further boosting your rewards. This approach encourages active participation and network growth, directly benefiting your earning potential.

## How can I use the network?

The UpRock network is managed by our team, ensuring the platform runs smoothly and evolves in line with our mission to democratize access to the digital economy. Governance involves strategic decisions, system updates, and community engagement, guided by our experience and commitment to the project's success.

## Who governs this network?

Currently, the UpRock network is managed by our team, focusing on smooth operations and strategic development. However, we're planning to establish a DAO for token holders. This DAO will allow token holders to submit proposals and vote on key platform decisions, giving our community a direct voice in shaping the future of UpRock. This move towards a more decentralized governance model reflects our commitment to community empowerment and shared decision-making in the network's evolution.

## Funding

While UpRock started with bootstrapping and self-funding, a core principle of web3 is community participation in value creation. As token holders, our users play a vital role in this ecosystem. Moving forward, we aim to broaden ownership opportunities for the $UPT token, including through an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) and listings on decentralized exchanges (DEXes). This strategy not only diversifies our funding approach but also deepens community involvement in UpRock's growth and success, aligning with the web3 ethos of shared benefits and decentralized participation.
