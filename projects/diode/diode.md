## About

# What is this network?

Diode is a leading Smart Network, its regional DePIN nodes provide essential communication infrastructure for applications such as the Diode App and CLI. This new generation of zero-trust software-defined networks builds upon hardened blockchain technology, superseding traditional cloud VPNs like Tailscale, ZeroTier, and Twingate.

## How can I mine tokens?

Tokens can be mined by setting up a Diode network relay node. The relay node is offering service for any Diode Network
applications and are being paid in Diode token every 4 week epoch for their service. You can learn more about how to host and operate your own on node on our [website](https://diode.io) and [support pages](https://support.diode.io).

## Any geographical restrictions?

There are no geographical restrictions to deploy Diode network relays. There might be different geographical restrictions though for Diode network based applications dependent on the application operator.

## How can I optimize my mining rewards?

The best way to optimize your mining rewards is to ensure your node providing the best service to network users. The metrics for these are:

1. Low latency
2. High uptime %
3. High bandwidth availability

Diode network devices will preferably choose your relay node if it offers the best latency and uptime. So you can optimize your mining rewards by choosing data centers for your relay node that are as near as possible to the active users who are currently under-served. For this it can be beneficial to setup multiple light and cheap relay nodes in different geographical locations rather than setting up a single heavy relay node.

## How can I use the network?

The Diode network can be used through the open source [Diode CLI](https://diode.io/solutions/cli/) the Diode App [Diode App](https://diode.io/solutions/app/) but also by other applications and developers using the [Diode SDK](https://github.com/diodechain/diode_client_ex). We will continue to expand the possibilities to use the Diode network in other applications and programming languages. 

## Who governs this network?

The Diode network is governed by the [Diode Foundation](https://diode.foundation).

## Funding

The Diode corporation is funded through selling Enterprise service on top of the Diode network including the [Diode App](https://diode.io/solutions/app/) and ZTNA networking features. The Diode foundation on the other hand is focused on the growth of the Diode network and manages the token treasury.
